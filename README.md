#### Description
I am currently actively looking for a job/internship for the Junior Java Developer vacancy (remote work or hybrid form. Ready to move).
Hello! My name is Sergey, I was born and live in the city of Zeya.
I started my career as a programmer in 2007. I developed circuit design and software for embedded systems based on PIC microcontrollers on assembler, later on C.
At the same time, I got acquainted with the GNU Linux OS and for more than ten years Debian has been my only operating system.
I administered my local network: about 40 clients, servers with Debian Linux OS (Squid proxy server, game server, file server), network equipment.
Since 2013, I have been working at RusHydro Group of Companies. My first position is an electrician at a communications station. Later I became an engineer at the communications and telemechanics department.
For the last few years, I have been working as a Engineer of the automated control systems section.
During this period, I have implemented the following projects:
1) A system of industrial gymnastics for the eyes.
Within the framework of the project implementing the formation of conditions for the safe performance of work at the Branch, I defended the project proposed by me, the team received a prize for implementation.
Implemented on several Bash scripts. The system displays on the screen of the users computer an invitation to undergo industrial gymnastics, with the consent of the user, a video clip with exercises is displayed.
The system has a modular structure, which allows for automatic updating of program modules. As part of the work, the rules for accessing the directory and files were also set up to ensure user safety and exclude the execution of arbitrary commands on user accounts.

2) A system for monitoring communication channels based on GSM modems. The system allows you to diagnose the main and backup communication channels with remote objects by polling equipment with AT commands.
Implemented on cmd scripts. It keeps a log of equipment polling and allows you to notify the operator about problems in the system.

3) A visualization system of the Branch's network resources
The system made it possible to add, edit and visualize the structure of objects, premises, and telecommunications equipment located in them.
The project was implemented in Python3, Flask, HTML5, JS, CSS, SQLite.
During the implementation of the project, I got acquainted with AJAX technology.
(due to the transition to a new site, the development was interrupted).

4) A device management system via COM port. The system manages multi-media devices by sending commands to the COM port of the devices on a schedule. The system is implemented in Bash scripts and is controlled through editing configuration files.

From June 2023 to the present, I have been studying at Hexlet to become a Java developer.
During the training period, he implemented two projects:

1) Brain Games Console Game
A collection of logical and mathematical games that runs in the console.
To complete the project, I used:

Setting up the environment for the implementation of a Java project, I used Intellij Idea as an IDE
Working with Gradle, Git and GitHub
Setting up and using the linter, as well as working with the CodeClimate service
Working with the Make utility
I carried out refactoring and code optimization.

2) Console utility "Difference Calculator"
A simple, lightweight and fast console utility capable of finding differences between two configuration files.
We support the following input file formats:
.json
.yml/yaml

To complete the project, I used:
Jackson, JaCoCo libraries
Picocli Framework
CI based on GitHub Actions
JUnit

Other skills:
Automated Testing (JUnit)
Knowledge of the OSI network model and the basics of the TCP/IP network troubleshooting
